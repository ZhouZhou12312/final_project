# final_project
Important Notes: Before you run the coding for this project, you should see some crucial initial setup files, which are essential for the coding programs to run: three Jupyter notebook coding files in the project file; one resume data csv file for training the model; one sample resume PDF, and one job description PDF (which you could replace with your resume and job description documents) 
The zipped file is only for some run results by local, if you want to check the result for the coding directly, without running the code. (since the actual running time for training the model takes more than an hour to finish)
)
